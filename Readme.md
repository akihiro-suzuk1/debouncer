# Debouncer

A simple debouncer for Rust, using Tokio for async timing. This crate provides a mechanism to debounce function calls, ensuring that only the last call within a specified delay is executed.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
debouncer = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example demonstrating how to use the Debouncer:

```rust
use tokio::time::Duration;
use debouncer::Debouncer;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let debouncer = Debouncer::new(Duration::from_secs(1));
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));

    let counter_clone = Arc::clone(&counter);
    debouncer.call(move || {
        async move {
            let mut num = counter_clone.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        }
    }).await;
}
```
