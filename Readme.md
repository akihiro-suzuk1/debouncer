# Debouncer

A simple debouncer for Rust, using Tokio for async timing. This crate provides a mechanism to debounce function calls, ensuring that only the last call within a specified delay is executed.

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
debouncer = "0.1.0"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example demonstrating how to use the Debouncer:

```rust
use tokio::time::Duration;
use debouncer::Debouncer;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let debouncer = Debouncer::new(Duration::from_secs(1));

    debouncer.call(|| println!("Function called!")).await;
    debouncer.call(|| println!("Function called again!")).await;

    for _ in 0..5 {
        debouncer.call(|| println!("Called multiple times!")).await;
        tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200)).await;
    }

    tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    debouncer.call(|| println!("Final call!")).await;
}
```
